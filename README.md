# CSV-Directory-Walker

In this project, I built a Java DIrectory walker that will go through all the sub directory in the directory it is pointed at. The application will further read all the CSV files present in them and add them to a seperate CSV file combining them all. Furthermore, if there are any incomplete records, such as missing values in a row, the application will skip them and keep a count of the number of valid and invalid records in the CSV.
